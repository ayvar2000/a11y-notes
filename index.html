                            Accessibility defines the standards and practices used to make websites easier to navigate and
                            use for people with disabilities, so they can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the
                            web.
                            Not being able to use web, or not to use it in full capacity and contribute, creates further
                            disadvantages for such people. Creating websites that are not inclusive deprives them of
                            participating in many important topics, such as job search and applications, communication and
                            support, many online services such as learning, ordering, dating and so on.
                            Disabilities include visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, motoric, language, learning and
                            neurological. Accessibility also includes the conditions that are not disabilities, but are result of
                            aging, such as low vision, memory loss and reduced motoric. There are also temporary and
                            situational disadvantages for the visitors and users, such as using phone in public transport,
                            bright sunlight, slow bandwidth, broken arm or lost glasses – all these should be taken into
                            account.
                            This article aims to provide short and understandable introduction to accessibility, its purpose
                            and principles. The first section touches upon basic requirements in design and writing,
                            whereas the second expands upon development for accessibility, with examples,
                            recommendations and best practices. This article is not comprehensive guide or in-depth
                            analysis of the topic of accessibility, but the links for the extra literature will be provided.

                            When developing a website, it is important to implement accessibility from the start. It should be
                            thought of when structuring our content, designing prototypes, spacing and color schemes,
                            writing headings, structuring the page navigation and correct usage and labeling of HTML
                            elements. Just by structuring our website content carefully and using correct HTML elements,
                            we can already greatly improve website’s accessibility.
                            There are three levels of accessibility compliance in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                            (WCAG):
                            A: essential - If this isn't met, assistive technology may not be able to read, understand, or fully
                            operate the page or view.
                            AA: ideal support – required for government and public body websites.
                            AAA: specialized support - typically reserved for parts of websites and web apps that serve a
                            specialized audience.
                            This guide and the practices described in it strive for AA compliance, providing ideal support to
                            disadvantaged users.

                        <p class="text-card__text">
                            Content is the most important part of the website.
    
                            Well-structured document outline enables smooth navigation of a website and its content.
                            Heading elements are necessary in structuring the content and making it easily recognizable for
                            the users and screen readers. Heading elements should not be used for purely visual purposes,
                            but should be used to describe topic or purpose for the AA level of accessibility.
                            It is recommended by W3C to have only one h1 element per page, which provides the user
                            with general information about the page and content; other heading elements help users find
                            specific content and orient themselves within the web page. We may also want to consider
                            putting the most important information at the beginning of each heading. This helps users skim
                            the headings to locate the specific content they need, and is especially helpful when browsers
                            or assistive technology allow navigation from heading to heading.
                            When structuring the document outline and its content, this example is useful to understand the
                            headings and the sections of content the headings describe, as well as the role of h1
                            element.
                            When writing the heading and navigation content for h, button and a elements, we
                            should make sure content is unique and descriptive; the information should be written in concise
                            and understandable language.
                            The instructions, guidance, and error messages must be clear, easy to understand, without
                            unnecessarily technical language. Input requirements, such as name, date formats and so on
                            should be properly described.

                    <h3 id="design" class="text-card__title">design</h3>
                        <p class="text-card__text">
                            When designing a webpage and UI, design should emphasize sufficient contrast between
                            foreground and background. Foreground text needs to have sufficient contrast with background
                            colors. This includes text on images, background gradients, buttons, and other elements. This
                            does not apply for logos or incidental text, such as text that happens to be in a photograph.
                            While color can be useful to convey information, color should not be the only way information is
                            conveyed. When using color to differentiate elements, also provide additional identification that
                            does not rely on color perception. For example, use an asterisk in addition to color to indicate
                            required form fields, and use labels to distinguish areas on graphs.
                            Use whitespace and proximity to make relationships between content more apparent. Style
                            headings to group content, reduce clutter, and make it easier to scan and understand.
                            Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as links and buttons, to make them easy to
                            identify. For example, change the appearance of links on mouse hover, keyboard focus, and
                            touch-screen activation. Ensure that styles and naming for interactive elements are used
                            consistently throughout the website.
                            Ensure that navigation across pages within a website has consistent naming, styling, and
                            positioning. Provide more than one method of website navigation, such as a site search or a site
                            map. Help users understand where they are in a website or page by providing orientation cues,
                            such as breadcrumbs and clear headings.
                            Ensure that all fields have a descriptive label adjacent to the field. For left-to-right languages,
                            labels are usually positioned to the left or above the field, except for checkboxes and radio
                            buttons where they are usually to the right. Avoid having too much space between labels and
                            fields.
                            Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission, alerting the user when
                            something goes wrong, or notifying the user of changes on the page. Instructions should be
                            easy to identify. Important feedback that requires user action should be presented in a
                            prominent style.

                            Consider how page information is presented in different sized viewports, such as mobile phones
                            or zoomed browser windows. Position and presentation of main elements, such as header and
                            navigation can be changed to make best use of the space. Ensure that text size and line width
                            are set to maximize readability and legibility.

                        As we noted before, introducing accessibility from the start helps us avoid the possible mess we
                        can run into when trying to structure content, assign headings, ARIA roles, labels and improve
                        keyboard accessibility in the later phases of development. Choosing the right HTML elements to
                        use, structuring our HTML correctly and thinking about the flow of content in terms of landmarks
                        accessed by user and their assistive technology, provides great accessibility points and saves
                        us time and money in the mid to long term.
                        This part of the article will cover recommended practices in development, as well as practical
                        solutions implemented in our work.
                        Important note: ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of roles and attributes
                        assigned to HTML elements, that define ways to make web content and web applications
                        (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities. ARIA
                        helps us greatly by making non-interactive HTML elements, such as div, interactive and
                        responsive to assistive technology by giving it explicit roles or description in the structure and
                        accessibility.
                        Because ARIA is so helpful, it comes with important rule - If you can use a native HTML
                        element, or an attribute with the required semantics and behavior already build in, do so.
                        This avoids unnecessary re-purposing of HTML elements by adding ARIA labels and properties,
                        allows for smoother accessibility, better structure and code maintenance.
                        As we dive deeper in development practices for accessibility, we will expand on its use on the
                        examples and in a separate section.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-card__title">page language and changes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Indicate the primary language of every page by using the lang attribute in the HTML tag, for
                        example html lang="en". Use the lang attribute on specific elements when the language of
                        the element differs from the rest of the page. This will help screen readers pronounce the
                        content more accurately.
                    </p>
                    <h4>provide title</h4>
                    <p>
                        The title element, contained in the document's head element, is often the first piece of
                        information announced by assistive technology. That’s why it is important to provide an accurate
                        and concise title to describe the page's purpose.
                        A common navigation technique for users of assistive technology is to read the page title and
                        infer the content the page contains. This is because navigating into a page to determine its
                        content can be a time consuming and potentially confusing process. Titles should be unique to
                        every page of a website, ideally surfacing the primary purpose of the page first, followed by the
                        name of the website. Following this pattern will help ensure that the primary purpose of the page
                        is announced by a screen reader first. This provides a far better experience than having to listen
                        to the name of a website before the unique page title, for every page a user navigates to in the
                        same website.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-card__title">Use mark-up to convey content meaning and structure</h4>
                    <p>
                        When writing about headings, we briefly touched the document structure by discussing
                        headings, and how to correctly use it to define content. When structuring the webpage, we are
                        defining content, navigation and accessibility through landmarks - special regions on the page to
                        which screen readers and other assistive technologies can jump.
                        Using an appropriate mark-up with correct elements as landmarks will greatly improve the
                        webpage navigation and screen reader accessibility.
                        If HTML sectioning elements are used without understanding the associated landmark structure,
                        assistive technology users will most likely be confused and less efficient in accessing content
                        and interacting with web pages.
                        HTML5 provides additional mark-up elements that define ARIA landmarks by default, and have
                        an implicit role recognized by screen readers and assistive technologies. The most important
                        and widely used elements are header, main, nav, aside and footer>, and using it, we
                        can structure our HTML without the need to explicitly set up role attributes for each content
                        section, because the assistive technology will recognize it.
                        Roles can provide additional meaning, for example, using role="search" to identify search
                        functionality, or having an ul element can be accessed by giving role=”list”.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-card__title">form control</h4>
                        <h5>label element</h5>
                        <p>
                            Label element
                            Forms and inputs of different type allow user interaction with the website, which is why every
                            input must be well-defined in order for user to understand what’s required.
                            The label element is used to define and explain input and input requirements to a user. It is
                            linked to appropriate input by using a for attribute on the label element linked to the id
                            attribute of the form element, or using attributes.
                            Example: for and id attributes
                            label for="username">Username label
                            input id="username" type="text" name="username"
                            In left-to-right languages, it is customary to visually position labels to the right of radio buttons
                            and checkboxes, and to the left or directly above other form fields. Maintaining this practice
                            increases predictability and understandability of your form for all users.
                            If the design requires label element to be visually hidden, we should not set visibility: hidden or
                            display: none as CSS properties, because the element will be hidden from the screen readers,
                            too. In such cases, screen reader and our visitor will not be able to understand the required
                            input and actions needed.
                            One way to visually hide the label, but still make it accessible to screen readers is to use CSS
                            class in a following or similar way (examples are from MDN and WCAG):

                            .not-visible {
                            position: absolute;
                            left: -9999px;
                            top: -9999px;
                            }
                            .visuallyhidden {
                            border: 0;
                            clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
                            height: 1px;
                            margin: -1px;
                            overflow: hidden;
                            padding: 0;
                            position: absolute;
                            width: 1px;
                            }

                            We can then append this class to the element we want to visually hide – for example, we want
                            to label the following user input that takes plain text as input type:
                            label for=’hidden-label’ class=”.not-visible” This label is not visible, but it can be accessed by
                            screen reader label
                            input name=”hidden-label’ id=”hidden-label” type=”text”
                            However, in this case, ARIA label can provide an invisible label, if a visible label cannot be used.
                        </p>
                        <h5>input element</h5>
                        <p>
                            Thanks to its type attribute, input element is versatile in providing different information, such as
                            date, e-mail, password, color, range and much, much more – see the list:
                            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input
                            We have already seen the importance of label and correct labeling of the input elements in order
                            to describe their functionality to user, and make it accessible to screen readers. However, we’ll
                            note few more input properties that improve their accessibility, and one is the placeholder
                            attribute (when input element is used to enter text, e.c. has type=”text” attribute).
                            Using placeholder allows us to communicate the exact purpose of the input field to the screen
                            reader, if no label or aria-label attribute has been set.
                            Interactive elements such as form input should provide an area large enough that it is easy to
                            activate them. This helps a variety of people, including people with motor control issues and
                            people using non-precise forms of input such as a stylus or fingers. A minimum interactive size
                            of 44×44 pixels, or the equivalent CSS measure, is recommended.

                    <h4 class="text-card__title">buttons</h4>
                    <p>
                        Buttons are clickable elements that trigger a response when activated by user. Any element can
                        have role=”button”, which tells screen reader an element is a button. This, however, does not
                        provide out-of-the-box button functionality, such as submitting the form, etc.

                        For that, we should use button element or input with a type=’button’. This way, it will be
                        accessible by keyboard, the content of the button will be understood by screen readers, and its
                        purpose and function to users. If the content of the button is an image or icon used for
                        illustrative purposes, we may assign the aria-label attribute to a button itself, and use the empty
                        alt tag in the image element, or the less-supported aria-role=”presentation”. This way, the
                        purpose and function of the button are communicated to the user, and the assistive technology
                        is not overflooded by extra information
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-card__title">images</h4>
                    <p>
                        Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by
                        them, and the WCAG lists the following purposes:
                        Informative images convey a simple concept or information that can be expressed in a short
                        phrase or sentence. The text alternative should convey the meaning or content that is displayed
                        visually, which typically isn’t a literal description of the image. Some examples are:
                        - simple and often seen, the telephone, email or fax icon – their alt tag should provide text
                        alternative such as alt=”telephone number” or similar;
                        - the image which shows a specific instruction on how to open a bottle; in this case, the info
                        shown in the image should be described in the alt tag of the image, such as, for example,
                        alt=”open the bottle by pressing down the cap and rotating to the left”;
                        - if an image supplements the text with additional information, alt tag should convey this
                        information without being redundant;
                        - if an image expresses the emotion or the specific meaning in the context of a website, alt tag
                        should communicate it – if a restaurant’s website has the image of a dog and the intent is to
                        show that the dogs are welcome, the correct alt tag would be alt=’we are dog friendly’,and not,
                        for example, ‘an image of a black-and-white border collie’;
                        - images conveying file format should have an alt tag with the file format communicated;
                        Ensure that alternative text for images is added to all informational and functional images. Use
                        empty alternative text, alt="" for decorative images, or include them in the CSS instead. Text
                        alternatives are usually provided by those responsible for written content – if, for example, an
                        image is used;

                        Decorative images, such as images used in design for purely decorative purposes, images that
                        are used as decoration to a text link, images that are described by adjacent text, or the ‘eye
                        candy’ images do not need a description in alt tag – therefore, alt=””. Such examples are the
                        image of a sleeping dog next to a text saying ‘The sleeping dog. The proverb says: ‘let the
                        sleeping dogs lie’.”. Eye candy, or the ambiance images are, for example, the image of sea and
                        waves on the website of surf-renting equipment – purely decorative.
                        Functional images are used to initiate actions rather than to convey information. They are used
                        in buttons, links, and other interactive elements. The text alternative for the image should
                        convey the action that will be initiated (the purpose of the image), rather than a description of
                        the image – for example, a print icon should have alt=’print’, instead of an image of a printer. In
                        our webcast, company’s logo in the upper left corner was wrapped in a tag and marked by
                        alt=”new tab”, whereas the aria-label instructed the user about functionality and purpose.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-card__title">ARIA</h4>
                    <p>
                        Accessibility is greatly improved by ARIA set of rules and attributes, some of it already
                        mentioned up in the previous examples. ARIA supplements HTML so that interactions and
                        widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is
                        not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible JavaScript widgets, form
                        hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.
                        We have mostly used aria-label=”” and aria-labelledby=”” to enable assistive technologies to

                        access parts of our website. Using the expandable lists in the language select menu, aria-
                        expanded attribute came in handy, as it provided the users with assistive technologies a way to

                        know that menu element was expanded and currently active, receiving focus. As mentioned,
                        aria-role=”presentation” can be an alternative in the presentation of decorative images,
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-card__title">keyboard accessibility</h4>
                    <p>
                        By default, only the interactive elements of a website or application are keyboard-accessible get
                        focused when using TAB key. With the tabindex, authors can make other elements focusable, too.
                        When set to 0, the element becomes focusable by keyboard and script. When set to -1, the
                        element becomes focusable by script, but it does not become part of the keyboard focus order.
                        The order in which elements gain focus when using a keyboard, is the source order by default.
                        In exceptional circumstances, we may want to redefine the order. To do this, we can set
                        tabindex to any positive number. In the case of our main webcast page, we used the
                        tabindex=”0”, for users to access elements in the source order. On the login page, it made more
                        sense for user to be able to access login form first. To avoid having keyboard user tab through
                        customer-defined content, we set tabindex=”1”; this allowed for user to navigate to content
                        optionally, after reaching the login form first.
                        To allow the user access the content such as polls, where the vote is selected and placed, JS
                        was used to loop through HTML elements, assigning it tabindex and aria-role=”button”
                        attributes. This way, poll was dynamically expanded to be reachable by keyboard. To visually
                        emphasize that the element has received keyboard focus, an event listener listening to focus
                        event was added.
                    </p>
                    <h5>keyboard traps</h5>
                    <p>
                        If a keyboard user is stuck within a component, with no means to exit the component focus with
                        a standard keyboard only and continue on to other interactive elements, it is called keyboard
                        trap.
                        When developing the player demo page, we used the external code editor widget to enable
                        users to customize player methods and get a better overview of its capabilities. However, the
                        code editor itself allowed for a keyboard trap – as user would tab into area to edit the code, they
                        could not exit the editor unless using the mouse. Because of that, we wrote the following
                        function using .focus() and .blur() methods:
                        editor.on('focus', function () {
                        let aceCont = document.querySelector('.config__editor')
                        var textArea = aceCont.getElementsByTagName('textarea')[0]
                        textArea.setAttribute('aria-label', 'Press Ctrl + m to exit the code editor')
                        if (editor.isFocused() === true) {
                        aceContainer.addEventListener('keydown', function (event: KeyboardEvent) {
                        if (event.ctrlKey && event.key == 'm') {
                        editor.blur()
                        }
                        })
                        }
                        })

                        Simple – when the editor element has received focus, an event listener was added that would
                        allow the user to press Ctrl + m key and blur the element, that is, to remove focus from the
                        current HTML element - in this case, editor. We searched for textarea HTML element and
                        assigned aria-label = “Press Ctrl + m to exit the code editor” to it, in order for the users to understand
                        how to avoid keyboard trap.
